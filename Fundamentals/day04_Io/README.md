# 📘 Day 04 – Input / Output (I/O) in C

Day 04 focuses on **Input / Output (I/O)** and **input safety** in C.  
This is one of the MOST IMPORTANT days because **90% of bugs in beginner C programs
come from bad input handling**.

If you understand Day 04 well, you are officially coding like a **real C programmer**.
