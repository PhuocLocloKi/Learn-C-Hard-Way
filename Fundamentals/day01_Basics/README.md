# Day 01 – C Basics

## Overview

This folder covers the fundamental concepts of the C programming language.
It is designed for beginners who are starting to learn C from scratch.

In this day, we focus on:
- Understanding the structure of a C program
- Working with variables and data types
- Input and output using standard libraries
- Basic operators and expressions
- Type conversion
- Using common standard C libraries


Each topic includes:
- A short theoretical explanation
- One or more small C source files for practice

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to C
- Basic structure of a C program
- `#include` directives
- The `main()` function
- Compilation and execution flow

### 2. Variables and Data Types
- Primitive data types (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`)
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Naming conventions
- Constants (`const`, `#define`)
- Variable scope (global vs local)

### 3. Input and Output
- Output using `printf()`
- Format specifiers (`%d`, `%f`, `%c`, `%lf`)
- Input using `scanf()`
- Address-of operator (`&`)

### 4. Operators
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Increment and decrement (`++`, `--`)
- Assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)

### 5. Type Conversion
- Implicit type conversion
- Explicit type casting
- Data loss and precision issues

### 6. Math Library
- Using `<math.h>`
- Common math functions: `sqrt()`, `pow()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, `fabs()`

## Goal of Day 01

By the end of Day 01, you should be able to:
- Write and run simple C programs
- Understand how data is stored and processed
- Use basic operators and input/output functions
- Read and write clean beginner-level C code
