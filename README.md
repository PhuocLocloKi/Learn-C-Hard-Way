# Learn C the Hard Way

A structured, hands-on repository documenting my journey of learning C programming — from logical fundamentals to algorithmic thinking and array-based data processing.

This project focuses on **how to think in C**, not just how to write syntax.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Is About

- Building strong logic and problem-solving skills  
- Understanding control flow, loops, and algorithms  
- Learning to structure programs cleanly  
- Developing confidence with arrays and data processing  
- Preparing a solid foundation for pointers and advanced C topics

## ▶ How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository  
2. Read the theory in `Fundamentals/`  
3. Practice by completing labs in `Labs/`  
4. Compile and run each program manually to understand every step  

> This repo is meant to be **read and practiced**, not skimmed.

## 🧪 Labs Overview

The `Labs/` directory contains a progressive set of exercises, ordered from simple logic to more advanced algorithmic tasks.

### Main Topics Covered

- Logical thinking & variable manipulation  
- Control flow (`if`, `switch`)  
- Loop structures & optimization  
- Mathematical & number-based logic  
- Modular programming with functions  
- Arrays and basic data structures  
- Searching and array transformations  

Each lab is designed to train **reasoning first**, then translate that reasoning into C code.

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- **Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** gcc  
- **Editor:** VS Code  
- **Platform:** Windows / Linux  

Example compile & run:

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
./main
```
🎯 Learning Approach

Analyze the problem
Design the logic
Write clean, readable C code
Test edge cases
Improve performance only after correctness

🚀 Why “Hard Way”?
C forces you to be precise. This repository intentionally avoids shortcuts to build real understanding, not surface-level familiarity.

If you can reason well in C, other languages become easier.
