## ▶️ How to Use This Repository

To get the most out of this course, follow this strict workflow:

1.  📥 **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2.  📖 **Read the theory** in the `Fundamentals/` directory first.
3.  ⌨️ **Practice** by completing the exercises in `Labs/`.
4.  ⚙️ **Compile & Run** manually to understand the linking process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **⚠️ Note:** This repo is meant to be **read and practiced**, not skimmed. Do not copy-paste solutions.

## 🧪 Labs Overview

The `Labs/` folder contains a progressive curriculum, evolving from simple logic to complex algorithms.

### 🔹 Main Topics Covered

| Category | Topics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logic & Flow** | 💡 Logical thinking, Variable manipulation, Boolean logic |
| **Control Structures** | 🔀 `if/else`, `switch` cases, State machines |
| **Iteration** | 🔁 `for`/`while` loops, Optimization techniques |
| **Mathematics** | 🔢 Number-based logic, Bitwise operations |
| **Architecture** | 📦 Modular programming, Function scope, Stack frames |
| **Data Structures** | 📑 Arrays (1D/2D), Structs, Buffers |
| **Algorithms** | 🔎 Linear/Binary Search, Array transformations |

*Each lab is designed to **train reasoning first**, then translate that reasoning into C code.*

## 🎯 Engineering Methodology

We follow a disciplined, 5-step engineering approach to ensure code quality:

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.** | 🧐 **Analyze** | Understand inputs, constraints, and expected outputs. |
| **2.** | 📝 **Design** | Draft the algorithm/flowchart *before* touching the keyboard. |
| **3.** | 💻 **Implement** | Write clean code focusing on readability and conventions. |
| **4.** | 🐞 **Test** | Break the code intentionally with edge cases & tricky inputs. |
| **5.** | ⚡ **Optimize** | Improve performance *only after* correctness is verified. |

## 🚀 The "Hard Way" Philosophy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **"C forces you to be precise."**
>
> This repository intentionally avoids shortcuts to build **real understanding**, not just surface-level familiarity. If you can reason well in C, high-level languages become trivial.
